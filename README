Welcome to the NDLUG Scavenger Hunt in the Shell!

Now that you know how to cat, let's practice listing directories and changing directories.

"ls" - lists contents of the current directory
"cd directory_name" - moves into 'directory_name'

You will also find it helpful that if you press Tab while you've partially typed a file or directory name, the rest of the name will appear as if you typed it.
It's pretty helpful for long names.

Start by following the yellow brick road!
